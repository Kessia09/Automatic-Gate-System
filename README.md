Automatic Gate Demo Kit
This project demonstrates how an Arduino Uno can control an automatic gate system using ultrasonic distance sensing.

âœ¨ Features
Object Detection: Uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects.

Automatic Gate Control:

Opens the gate using a servo motor when an object is within 50 cm.

Keeps the gate open while the object remains detected.

Closes the gate automatically after 5 seconds of no object detection.

LED Indicators:

Red LED: Gate is closed.

Blue LED: Gate is open.

Buzzer Alert: Continuously beeps while the gate is open.
